This is a project I am working on to get familiar with the nuances of 3d programming. The bulk of this code was copied from the 
excellent RasterTek tutorial, available here: http://www.rastertek.com/tutgl40.html

As well as this I am using http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/, to allow me to gain an appreciation of 3D programming, and allow me to begin
building 3d applications with a good grounding and perspective of what is needed.
